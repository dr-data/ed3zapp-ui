# Welcome to Ed3Zapp

**Ed3Zapp** - Incentivizing learners and Course creators **instantly**.

## Preamble 

**COVID** has changed learning forever. There is a paradigm shift in the way people learnt pre and post COVID, there is high growth and adoption in Education Technology. We are experiencing an unplanned and rapid migration to online learning. A huge number of people started joining online courses to **reskill** and **upskill**.

It is clear that this pandemic has utterly disrupted the way we learn. It had both positive and negative impacts. There was a terrible disconnect between the enrollment rate and completion rate which questioned the impact of online learning.

## Problem Statement

Learner's drop out rate is up by **67 %** with most of them leaving due to a lack of Motivation and engaging content. We need to fix this problem by focusing on ways to **Motivate** the users ,Personalise and **Reward** their learning journey.

For Course Creators,
Inability to influence learners behavior and delayed payments

For Platform,
Expensive to onboard new learners and attract new Course Creators

## Mission Statement 

To build an dApp which instantly rewards the learner as well the content creator. 
We enable the content creators to influence the learners behavior and make them consistent and engaged. How ?
The Course creator incentivizes the learners by offering a reward when they achieve a milestone.

## Our solution
We created a dApp that can connect learner and content creator together to achieve learning goals, that can create business impact for the organization. Content creator can signup, create courses, assign reward for courses. Learners can signup, purchase and learn the courses, take assessment and earn rewards in USDCx super token. Learners can unwrap the token to stable coin and withdraw to their exchange account.
